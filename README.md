# fix-ntfs-mount-linux

*Brave enough to use Ubuntu 23.10 (like myself) only to have the os freeze in the middle of using an ntfs drive?*
thats where ``fix_drive.sh`` comes in!

(**ONLY USE THIS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING**)

# Usage 

*If a drive fails to mount, 9/10 its because it has a dirty flag and needs to checked manually and removed*
**sometimes it fixes itself on reboot**

**SOMETIMES**

clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/Af7eR9l0W/fix-ntfs-mount-linux`

make it executable 

`chmod +x *sh`

run the script as sudo

`sudo ./fix_drive.sh`

**Follow the instructions**
*it gives you plenty of time to back out*
